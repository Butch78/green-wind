# Paper & Presentation Compiling

We used [Latexdevcontainer](https://github.com/qdm12/latexdevcontainer) to compile the paper and presentation.
We simple had to copy accoss the files from the ```reports/``` folder to the [Latexdevcontainer](https://github.com/qdm12/latexdevcontainer) project and it would produce the pdf files on save.


# Set Up Instructions

### Option 1: Github Codespaces (devcontainer) - Automatic Dev Environment

To get started, create a codespace for this repository by clicking this ðŸ‘‡

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=master&repo=708763302)

A selection menu will open allowing you to create a Codespace. After create a Codespace it  will open in a web-based version of Visual Studio Code. The [dev container](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) is fully configured with software needed for this project along with added development vscode extensions such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter), Python, and Docker.

It should Automatically build the application and install the ```requirements.txt``` file. if not run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Local Machine

This repository can be [used locally](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) on a system running Visual Studio Code and Docker, or in a remote cloud based [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) environment as shown in Option 1.

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your local machine, if not follow the instructions here: <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>

2. Clone the repository to your local machine
   ```git clone https://github.com/Butch78/Bank-Size-Central-Bank-Sensitivity.git```

3. After you open the root project in Vscode, the following pop-up should appear. Click "Reopen in Container"

![Alt text](assets/dev_containter_popup.png)

If not click the button in the bottom left corner and then select "Reopen in Container" or type into the command prompt at the top an enter the following command ```>Reopen in container```

This will build the Docker container and should install the requirements.txt file 
Automatically build the application and install the ```requirements.txt``` file along with creating a PostgresDB instance. if not run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Start Application Command

rename the ```.env.example``` in the root directory to ```.env```

Then the following command will load the Data into the PostgresDB and start a FastAPI application on port 8000, You can view the API documentation at <http://localhost:8000/docs>

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Once the application has started The csv files from ```/data/raw```  will automatically be loaded into the PostgresDB instance. 

We can then connect to the Jupyter Notebook: ```notebooks/snb-data-processing.ipynb```  to explore the data with a read only connection to the PostgresDB instance.
